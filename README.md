## 🔑 Passwords Tested

| Password Example       | Composition                              | Strength Result (Score/Feedback)    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `password123`          | Lowercase + numbers (weak, short)        | Weak – easily guessed, common       |
| `Pass@123`             | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbol | Medium – stronger but short length  |
| `MySecure!2025`        | Mixed case + numbers + special char      | Strong – harder to guess            |
| `7h!sIs@V3ry$tr0ngPwd` | 18 chars, mixed case, symbols, numbers   | Very Strong – high complexity, long |

## 📊 Results & Observations

* **Length**: Longer passwords greatly improve strength.
* **Diversity of Characters**: Using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes brute-force attacks harder.
* **Predictability**: Common words (e.g., "password") are weak even with numbers added.
* **Feedback from Tools**: Most checkers recommend at least **12–16 characters with mixed complexity**.

## ✅ Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

1. Use **at least 12–16 characters**.
2. Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
3. Avoid **dictionary words** or common substitutions (`P@ssw0rd` is still weak).
4. Prefer **passphrases** (e.g., `Giraffe$BlueSky#2025!`).
5. Use a **password manager** to store complex and unique passwords for each account.

## 🔐 Common Password Attacks

* **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations until success. (Longer + complex passwords reduce feasibility.)
* **Dictionary Attack**: Uses lists of common passwords/words. (Avoid real words to resist this.)
* **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked credentials from one site on others. (Always use unique passwords per account.)

---

## 📌 Conclusion

* Strong passwords balance **length + complexity + unpredictability**.
* Testing passwords with online tools helps visualize weaknesses.
* **Password complexity directly affects resistance** against brute-force and dictionary attacks.
